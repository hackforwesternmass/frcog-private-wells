data/
Contains various raw well-data files received from Glenn.
The original files from Glenn were missing plenty of lat/longs and were fed
through a geocoder to get that info. DO NOT USE THE ORIGINAL FILES, INSTEAD
USE THE FILES CREATED FROM A DUMP OF THE OLD DB (WHICH HAD LAT/LONGS UPDATED)
The csv file is the file that David put together for the google fusion tables
solution. It may contain extra wells that Glenn is not interested in, and it
may be missings some data that Glenn is interested in...not sure
