#Memento Database Installation for Android Devices

The following instructions will allow you to install the Memento
Database and Private Well Databases onto your Android device.

There are two different actions you need to take. The first is to
install the Memento Database App, which will be the app used to view and
edit Well data. The second action is to set up the App on your device to
give it access to the various towns.

##Installation of Memento Database App
